This is the AntennaHacker project. 

The goal of this project is to build off of the AntennaTracker project to 
create a system to track a drone and subsequently remotely execute commands to
the drone from a GCS. The first iteration of the project will utilize the AntennaTracker
stationary functionality to track the target and send a simple Return to Home
command. Future iterations might include additional commands or scripts
and will hopefully utilize the mobile AntennaTracker functionality.
